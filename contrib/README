do_builds.sh:
------------

This script allows the automation of the builds with several different
configure options.
It does autogen.sh, configure and reports success and of failure.
To setup:

   1. Create a directory *outside* of the source directory in order
   not to be "hammered" by autogen. You use a build directory directly
   below the top source directory IF you do not set the HAMMER variable
   in the configuration file (,,conf)

   2. Run the script from *that* directory. That will create a ,,conf 
   file, which you *must* edit to at least point to the sxemacs source
   directory.

   3. Create several .conf files, one for each of you different
   configurations. On this file place all the options you'd usually
   pass on to configure. If you would set environment variables like
   CC or CFLAGS, you can do so at the end of the file with <var>=<value>
   
   4. Execute do_builds.sh

git-post-receive-hook.sample
----------------------------
This hook is meant as git hook (ie to be placed in the hooks directory
of your publicly accessible repository) as a way to automatically send
emails when you want something to be merged to the master branch.

It assumes you will use a for-steve branch, as git-to-steve.sh will do
for you, so it will only send emails for changes to that branch.

This script will not send an email on a "fast-forward" or "merge"
commit, so that you won't bother Steve if you keep a long lived
for-steve branch, and even share it accross machines...

To use, just place it under the name post-receive in the hooks
directory of your git public repository.

You may wish to review it and make sure the branch(es) you want to
send mail for are there and the location of the post-receive-email
script which should come with your git install.

git-for-steve.sh
---------------

This script will check your git configuration, give you some
recommendations of changes and create a for-steve branch so that you
use the same convention as the other SXEmacs developers to contribute
to the SXEmacs project.

Nelson Ferreira <njsf@sxemacs.org>


make-pkg.sh:
-------------
This script conveniently creates a tar from your workspace for use
in systems without proper autoconf or tla.

It needs to be run from the top of source directory and requires
the name of the package to be given.

Usage: contrib/make-pkg.sh <package-name> [<package-location>]

Example: contrib/make-pkg.sh sxemacs-22.1.9 $HOME/public_html
will create a sxemacs-22.1.9.tar.gz in your html area.

pop3.el.patch:
-------------
This patch is meant to be applied to pop3.el from the mail-lib package.

This patch provides SSL/TLS support for Gnus based on SXEmacs' native
OpenSSL interface.  It works with the stream types 'ssl and 'starttls,
so mail-sources already using one of these stream types will just keep
on working.

An example mail source for a POP3 TLS connection:

	(pop :server "some.pop3.server.tld"
	     :user "me"
             :password "verysecret"
             :stream starttls)

An example mail source for a POP3s server:

	(pop :server "some.pop3s.server.tld"
	     :user "anotherme"
	     :password "verysecret"
	     :port 995
	     :stream 'ssl)

The provided functionality has drop-in behaviour, so anything that worked
before will keep on working.

report-build-failure.sh:
-----------------------
Send an email to the SXEmacs developers mailing list with the details
needed to troubleshoot failures to build SXEmacs.

The script requires your email address.

Usage: contrib/report-build-failure.sh superhacker@sxemacs.org

When tla is available the script will find the branch and closeness to
the main branch as well as uncommitted changes.

show-tty-256-color.pl:
----------------------
This script is from the X distribution and outputs a 6x6x6 color cube
as well as a grayscale ramp consistent with the default 256 color xterm
settings.
You can use it to see if your terminal is capable of showing 256 colors.

smtpmail.el.patch:
-----------------
This patch is meant to be applied to smtpmail.el from the mail-lib
package.

This patch provides SSL/TLS support for smtp connections using SXEmacs'
native OpenSSL interface.  It works out of the box with the usual
credential definitions.

Additionally extends the smtpmail-starttls-credentials specifications by
another argument, the fifth one, which can be a certificate authority's
certificate file.  If specified the server must present a valid
certificate signed by or verifiably by the certificate authority.

An example credential:

	(setq smtpmail-starttls-credentials
	      '(("some.smtp.server.tld" 25	;; server+port
		 "~/.certs/my.smtpd.key"	;; the cert's secret key
		 "~/.certs/my.smtpd.cert"	;; the public cert
		 "~/.certs/smtp.server.ca"	;; server's ca cert
		)))

starttls.el.patch:
-----------------
This patch is meant to be applied to starttls.el from the mail-lib
package.

This patch provides some basic SSL/TLS functionality used by other stuff
in the mail-lib package.  Basically it just pretends to be Josefsson's
starttls.el.  Instead of calling the gnutls binary externally the
internal OpenSSL API functions are used.

tar-build-failure.sh
--------------------
Script that creates a tar file withe the contents that would also
be emailed by report-build-failure.sh

Nelson Ferreira <njsf@sxemacs.org>


tty-colors.c
------------
C program using the curses library that detects the number of colors,
the code sequences and can show the available colormap.
Compile with:
	gcc -o tty-colors tty-colors.c -lncurses 
Invoke with:
       -m	Do a colormap
       -c	Do all foreground/background color combinations
       -f	Force the output of the basic ansi colors
       -s	Force the use of standout code
       -bs	Force the use of both bold and standout codes
       -q	Try to query the color map from the terminal
